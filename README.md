# WhatsApp-exceed-limitation

automation script to allow user to forward messages to unlimited users

first of all we need to automate in a pre opened  session {
if you are using linux type in terminal 

google-chrome --remote-debugging-port=9222 --user-data-dir="bb"

if you are using using windows, open chrome file location and open cmd in it and type 

chrome.exe --remote-debugging-port=9222 --user-data-dir="bb"

and the chrome options steps as written in java file here}

the first time you run the code go to whatsapp web then make the authentication then run the code again 


You can add many contacts as you want in the array called names, also you can adjust the message as you want in string message
